# mint_transactions
Analysis on the all account transactions from Mint Application. The project is to determine the inflow and outflow of money across all the accounts (saving, checking, Brokerage, credit cards account, 401K, Roth, HSA)
Steps on Analysing the data:-
  Download the CSV dataset from mint app
  Try to derive all the expenditure across all the expense category
  It would need to create multiple level of category to bucket the expense category
    One high level category can have many subset category
  There will be a need to fix the category assigned by mint.
  Another goal is to notice the pattern in expenses from month to month.
  
All the analysis has been done in Jupyter notebook.
